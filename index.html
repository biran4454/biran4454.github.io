        <h1>Welcome</h1>
        <p>Good to see you! I'm an aspiring programmer from the UK, for more info see my <a href="https://github.com/biran4454">Github profile</a>.</p>
        <p>Stripe requires me to have a website to accept donations, so here it is! It's pretty bare and handcoded, but I don't expect many people to see this so that's fine.</p>
        <p>Donations are appreciated! The bot costs about Â£8 a month to run; not much but not cheap either. I'm a hardworking student with lots of stressful stuff happening, and any small donations help encourage and support me.</p>
        <p>A lot of my newer projects are private on github, but maybe in the future I'll release them (if I get around to finishing them)</p>
        <p>I use Copilot a tonne, so thanks to them for making it! (that part was written by copilot lol)</p>
        <p>Feel free to say hi on discord (Biran4454#7467) or email (biran4454@pm.me), I'm generally around daily, and I am always happy to say hi, look at memes or furry art, talk about tech (when I'm not at college).</p>
        <p>I love dubstep + brostep, old and new.</p>
        <p>Considering I'm very cautious about privacy and personal information, I have probably revealed waaay too much here but who cares, I'll leave that as a regret for future me.</p>
        <p>Yes, these sentences were written with one &lt;p&gt; tag each. Yes, this site looks like it is <a href="https://www.phys.ksu.edu/personal/wysin/astro/magnitudes.html">from the 1990s</a>. No, I'm not going to do anything about it.</p>
